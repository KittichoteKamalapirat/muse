Why we need SSR cookie forwarding

for SSR
    browser -> next.js (cookie sent to next.js) -> graphq (cookie is gone here); 
    therefore, vote Status is not working here (when refresh the homepage)(no red and green), because red and green looks 
    wherether there is the req.session.userId in the votes or not

    
Client side request (not ssr)
    browser -> graphql (cookie sent to graphql)
    However, but it works when we create a post then redirected to homepage, 
    because there is cookei sent to the graphql (not ssr)


    So we have to tell next.js server to send the cookie over to the graphql
    (basically add the context)
